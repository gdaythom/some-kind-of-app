      "longDescription": "In the first chapter of the series that started a cultural phenomenon, Kirk, Spock, and McCoy project humanity into the 23rd century with compassion, boldness, and a curiosity to meet the unknown. For more than 40 years, viewers hungry for optimism have found inspiration from Gene Roddenberry's visionary allegory, hooked on the thought-provoking moral tales, the humor, the romance, the philosophy, and the inspired gadgetry aboard the first <i>U.S.S. Enterprise<\/i>. Now these remastered adventures look and sound even better than ever, with dozens of new and higher-detailed visual effects that blend seamlessly into the episodes you fondly remember."

Balok's perceived power is heightened even more by a more textured and crystalline Fesarius at close-up, a highlight of the Remastered edition. His smaller ship is seen towing the bigger Enterprise in several new angles, and colors emitted by Balok's glowing warning buoy actually reflect off the starship's hull."

      "shortDescription": "Kirk suspects Shakespearean actor Anton Karidian as a mass murderer.",
      "longDescription": "As one of the two surviving witnesses to the mass murders of \"Kodos the Executioner,\" Kirk learns that the criminal may be disguising himself as an actor in a traveling troupe. But Shakespeare has nothing on this real-life tragedy once Kirk meets the suspect's beautiful daughter. Though a story light on visual effects, this Remastered edition does show off beautiful new close-ups of the Enterprise -- and watch for the moving stars outside the ship's outer observation window."

The stranded Kirk and Spock follow him back to set things right, where a tragic love tests Kirk's resolve. Viewers of the Remastered edition will get a much more detailed vision of the \"time planet\" from space, and an even more evocative final fade-out amid Kirk's grief and fatigue."
