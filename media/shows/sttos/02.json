      "longDescription": "The sounds, the look, and all-new digital effects that hold close to the spirit of the original are all here in the critically acclaimed \"Remastered\" editions of the classic <i>Star Trek<\/i> series of the 1960s. Available in their full-length, original format without the cuts of syndicated television, the vivid Remastered versions make <i>Star Trek<\/i> new again, without compromising what made the show a pioneer of modern, continuing-character science fiction.  In the first chapter of the television series that started a cultural phenomenon, Kirk, Spock, and McCoy project the best of humanity into the 23rd century with compassion, boldness, and a curiosity to meet the unknown.  For more than 40 years viewers hungry for optimism have found inspiration from Gene Roddenberry's visionary allegory, hooked on the thought-provoking morality tales, the humor, the romance, the philosophy, and the inspired gadgetry aboard the first U.S.S. <i>Enterprise<\/i>."

The high-elevation nature of the pon farr ceremonial grounds echoes the landscapes of Vulcan of the later motion pictures, but only enhances the mood and the music of the classic tragic battle set up by Spock's manipulating childhood fiancé, T'Pring. Sharp-eyed fans will note the distant views of Spock's hometown -- an homage to artwork later used in \"Star Trek: Enterprise\" -- and a new setting for T'Pring's girlhood photo."

The routine landing party beam-up is snagged by a new smeary ion storm effect for Kirk, Scotty, McCoy and Uhura's entry into the savage parallel universe. New visuals especially enhance the cruelty of this dimension, with the agonizer and the agony booth both getting a creepier, more visceral CGI treatment. The \"mirror\" Kirk finds he has a sexy \"captain's woman\" and a \"Tantalus field,\" that ruthless secret death machine he can turn on anyone remotely -- but will he ever get his people back home?"

Investigating the loss of sister starship Constellation, the Enterprise stumbles across a huge alien superweapon that wrecked not only the lost ship but also entire planets in several solar systems -- and drove Commodore Matt Decker into a \"Ahab complex\" that threatens the Enterprise when he forcibly takes command. Now, see the sad wreckage of the Constellation in all-new detail, get a truer sense of scale with both starships, their shuttlecraft and the planet-killer, which gets an articulated treatment that truly enhances its robot-like mission of destruction. Remastered effects also let viewers truly see for the first time the choreography of the battle with each starship's strafing runs -- and there's even a new angle on the shuttlecraft departure."

While struggling to discover the source of the pair's apparent transformational powers, Kirk wonders whether one alien's attraction to him is any more dangerous than the widening dispute between the two."

The Remastered version features an all-new detailed shuttlecraft landing in the hangar bay and the Orion spy ship, faithful to the original but finally seen in detail -- as well as the Enterprise phaser tracking system which tries to shoot it down."

Incredibly, Spock's research, witnesses, and two more murdered women eventually point to the murderer as the entity behind the original serial killer, Earth's \"Jack the Ripper.\" The new vibrant look of the Remastered treatment is at its best as always, but be sure to look for the lights of cities on the planet's dark side, matching how the live action of the story all takes place at night."

It's a perfect example of the reason for the Prime Directive of non-interference, but Kirk, with an incredulous McCoy and \"Spock-o\" in tow,  decides the best way to heal the damage is to play the part of mobsters themselves -- even if it means learning to drive a car. Along with its crisper, more colorful look overall, the Remastered edition also features a new treatment for the one time we see ship-fired phasers on stun."

The lifeform is not sentient but still deadly on a mass scale, consuming the Gamma 7A system, the Vulcan-manned USS Intrepid and anything in its path while draining nearby power sources. The Remastered look now gives Enterprise a true \"nighttime\" treatment while within the \"zone of darkness\" around the amoeba, and both Spock's shuttlecraft suicide mission and the starship itself now seem truly trapped within the amoeba in a host of more complex and scaled environments."
